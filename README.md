# Court Judgments Prediction using Machine Learning
Judgments Prediction of Supreme Court of Nigeria (SCN)

**I have used Machine Learning to predict the judgements of the Supreme Court of Nigeria (SCN) based on a dataset from Primsol Law Pavillion and explained the predictions through Explainable AI.**

**About the Dataset:
In the dataset, historical data of appeal cases presented at the Supreme Court of Nigeria (SCN) were collected from an online repository (Primsol Law Pavillion). A total of 5585 appeal cases brought before the SCN were collected from the archive. The dataset included criminal and civil appeal cases brought before the SCN.**
